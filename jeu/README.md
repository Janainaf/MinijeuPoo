#### Mini video game in OOP - training OOP

The game is broken down into 3 versions:

* Version 1 is file  app.rb

This game consists of two bots fighting till death. They take turns attacking each other, losing life points until one of them perishes. 

----

* Version 2 is file $ruby app2.rb

More interactive, here a HumanPlayer attcaks two bots. HumanPlayer has some advantages - it starts with 100 life points; can change weapons and can heal with health packs. The bots are the same from version 1. Every turn HumanPlayer is faced with some choices - can change weapons,  get a life pack or the bot of your choice. The game is over when both bots have 0 life points (in which case HumanPlayer wins); or HumanPlayer dies with 0 life points and loses the game.

----

* Version 3 is missing/incomplete but should be $ruby app3.rb

Should have several bots that are added during battle.
